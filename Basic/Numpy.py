"""
In this class I will be using Numpy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
It contains among other things:

- A powerful N-dimensional array object. Also called Tensor.
- Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions and vectorization.
- Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient
multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined.
This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
